 this phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through congress 
 this interpretation was officially endorsed by congress in N in the iran-contra report

 investors in stock funds did n't panic the weekend after mid-october 's 190-point market plunge

 we keep wondering what mr. gates wanted to say 
 perhaps he 'd have called for a <unk> political and economic system without a dominant communist party 
 or political arrangements to alleviate the <unk> and demands of soviet ethnic minorities and republics 
 it 's somehow ok for secretary baker himself however to say all the same things 
 in fact he did the quotes above are from mr. baker 's speech of two weeks ago 
 but everyone agrees that mr. gorbachev 's problems result from the failure of his own system 
 they can be relieved only by changing that system not by pouring western money into it 
 if a deal can be made to cut the world 's <unk> loose from moscow why not 
 we do n't expect much good from <unk> control but <unk> talks might <unk> eastern europe 
 yet much of the political culture seems intent on <unk> the bush administration for not helping mr. gorbachev 
 mr. baker seems especially sensitive to the washington <unk> known as <unk> 
 letting officials express their own <unk> can be educational 
 it is in the western interest to see mr. gorbachev succeed 
 the odds are against him as he himself would no doubt tell you 
 the ultimate outcome depends on what he does not on what we do

 among these crimes are murder on federal land presidential assassination and <unk> 
 the thurmond bill would also add five new crimes punishable by death including murder for hire 
 separately the senate last week passed a bill permitting execution of <unk> who kill americans abroad 
 for one thing it 's unlikely that many people would receive federal death sentences let alone be executed 
 in that sense the whole debate is sort of a fraud argues a democratic senate staff member 
 executions regardless of how frequently they occur are also proper <unk> for <unk> crimes mr. hatch argues 
 the amendment prompted an ironic protest from mr. thurmond who complained that it would kill capital punishment 
 and the kennedy amendment would <unk> not only federal but state <unk> in two important ways 
 and it would shift the burden to prosecutors to <unk> that discrimination caused any statistical racial <unk> 
 that burden is very difficult if not impossible to meet says mr. boyd 
 how do you prove a negative 
 the kennedy amendment would in effect <unk> around the supreme court ruling 
 but if it <unk> it could prompt other statutory changes according to the mr. <unk> 
 narrowing the penalty in this fashion would clearly reduce whatever <unk> effect it now has 
 and that in turn would only strengthen the argument of those who oppose execution under any circumstances

 copper futures prices failed to extend friday 's rally 
 declines came because of concern that demand for copper may slow down 
 at the time merchants were asking for premiums of about five cents a pound 
 all this has led to prolonged selling in futures mostly on the part of computer-guided funds 
 prices fell through levels regarded as important support areas which added to the selling

 now the personal-computer revolution is finally reaching japan 
 in april the long-term credit bank linked its computers in tokyo with its three american offices 
 productivity in japanese offices is relatively low 
 but it also offers opportunities americans are well poised to supply the weapons 
 but for now at least americans are far better at making pcs and the software that runs them 
 after years of talking about selling in japan more and more u.s. companies are seriously pouring in 
 apple computer inc. has doubled its staff here over the past year 
 <unk> inc. has a bigger share of the <unk> market in japan than at home 
 but the japanese have to go a long way to catch up 
 but amid the two dozen bureaucrats and secretaries sits only one <unk> pc 
 moreover japanese offices tend to use computers less efficiently than american offices do 
 in the u.s. pcs commonly perform many tasks and plug into a broad network 
 in japan many desktop terminals are limited to one function and ca n't <unk> with other machines 
 but the machines are n't on employees ' desks they ring the <unk> of the large office 
 some machines make charts for <unk> 
 others analyze the data 
 to transfer information from one to the other employees make <unk> and enter the data <unk> 
 to <unk> charts to branch offices they use a fax machine 
 in an efficient <unk> the same pc could perform all those tasks 
 in japan those functions account for only about a third of the software market 
 in the u.s. <unk> of the office pcs are <unk> up to some sort of network 
 in japan about N N are linked 
 but healthy skepticism is only a small reason for japan 's pc lag 
 various cultural and economic forces have <unk> demand 
 and japan 's management system makes it hard to impose a single integrated computer system <unk> 
 until recently much of the necessary technology has been unavailable or at least <unk> 
 some analysts estimate the average pc costs about N N more in japan than the u.s. 
 but the complex language is n't the only reason 
 with little competition the computer industry here is inefficient 
 the u.s. market too is dominated by a giant international business machines corp 
 but early on ibm offered its basic design to anybody wanting to copy it 
 dozens of small companies did swiftly establishing a standard operating system 
 that is the state of japan 's computer industry 
 meanwhile the big players have n't tried to copy the nec standard 
 corporate pride as well as the close ties common among japanese manufacturers help explain why 
 they hesitate to market <unk> machines nec <unk> of such machines and marketing one would jeopardize their relationship 
 the result according to many analysts is higher prices and less innovation 
 there are no price wars no competition 
 but the market is changing 
 the government is funding several projects to push pc use 
 over the next three years public schools will get N million pcs a <unk> increase from current levels 
 meanwhile more computer makers now are competing for the new business 
 it has won about N N of the retail pc market 
 but it could also help american companies which also are starting to try to open the market 
 though no formal trade barriers exist the japanese computer industry is difficult for outsiders to enter

 but the americans are also to blame 
 they long made little effort here

 only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the <unk> level 
 scientists call the new class of genes <unk> or simply <unk> genes 
 when <unk> normally they make proteins that hold a cell 's growth in check 
 the newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called <unk> 
 like all genes tumor-suppressor genes are inherited in two copies one from each parent

 dr. <unk> made his retinoblastoma discovery in N 
 then last spring researchers reported finding a gene called p53 which if <unk> turns healthy colon cells <unk> 
 they have about seven candidates

 occasionally gross chromosome damage was visible

 but he did n't know which gene or genes had disappeared 
 the finding <unk> medicine 
 it was extraordinarily satisfying says dr. <unk> now at fox chase cancer research center in philadelphia 
 i was convinced that what was true of retinoblastoma would be true for all cancers 
 it was an <unk> claim 
 gradually a <unk> picture of cancer development emerged 
 if both copies of a certain gene were knocked out benign <unk> would develop 
 if both copies of a second gene were then <unk> the <unk> would progress to <unk> 
 it was clear that more than one gene had to be damaged for colon cancer to develop 
 their report galvanized other <unk> <unk> 
 they focused on chromosome N 
 such a piece of dna would probably constitute a gene 
 when they found it last winter dr. vogelstein was dubious that the search was over 
 the <unk> dr. vogelstein found was in exactly the same spot as p53 
 evidence now is emerging that the p53 <unk> gene is involved in other cancers too 
 the p53 gene has just been <unk> in lung cancer 
 at the same time the johns hopkins team and others are rushing to pinpoint other tumor-suppressor genes

 as a result he <unk> the inflation that mrs. thatcher through a long and costly effort had subdued 
 with inflation surging the pound began falling against the mark 
 this put mrs. thatcher in a <unk> 
 the reason is simple 
 the price of attracting capital whether one 's own or that of foreigners is a trade deficit 
 to avoid this deficit mr. lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise 
 this <unk> policy could not prevent a british trade deficit 
 little wonder that mrs. thatcher 's opponents were so anxious to keep mr. lawson in office 
 it is extraordinary that the british treasury thought it could prevent a trade deficit by <unk> the pound
